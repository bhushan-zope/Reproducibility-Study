# Reproducibility-Study
This study aims to reproduce the results for TorusE, PairRE, NodePiece, and CompGCN. 
We have used PYKEEN library for the KGEM implementation. 



Note: Few results are kept here. Many other results were recorded and files were replaced with new result files in next iteration.
